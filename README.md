# Etch-A-Sketch

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a basic etch-a-sketch type grid
that the user can hover over to change colors. This project highlights
my knowledge of basic DOM manipulation techniques, as well as CSS
variables.

### Future Improvements
* Make mobile-friendly
* Consider extending the white background to slightly beyond the borders
  of the grid, so that there's a little more whitespace between the
  colorful background and the grid itself.
* Figure out how to get a "click and drag" functionality. So that
  instead of on mouseover, it's on click, and then hold, that the grid
  cell colors change.

#### Links for Credit
[CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) was used to create the gradient
effect for the page background color, as well as the background colors
of the Random Color and Shades of Gray buttons.
